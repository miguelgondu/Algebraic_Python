# Algebraic_Python
A small library about algebraic structures.

Algebraic_Python pretends to create algebraic structures such as groups and rings using python sets.

The philosophy behind the implementation of Algebraic_python is simple: operations are considered as functions, and functions are considered as sets of tuples (that is, instead of writing _f(x) = y_ we write _(x,y) in f_; and instead of writing _ab = c_ we say _((a,b), c)) in Operation_).

Algebraic_python tackles objects such as functions and relations (in Set_theory.py) and groups (in Group_theory.py). Recently, a new Lie_theory.py has been added, in which matrix visualization is studied using facts from Lie theory in matrices and matrix curves.
